# TradeDrift Matching Engine

**Document:** 02_System_Architecture.md  
**Service:** Matching Engine  
**Version:** V1.0  
**Status:** ✅ Design Complete  
**Last Updated:** July 2026

---

# 1. Purpose

This document describes the internal architecture of the TradeDrift Matching Engine.

The Matching Engine is designed around independent **Market Engines**, where each Market Engine exclusively owns a single trading pair and processes all events for that market sequentially.

The architecture is designed so that it can run as:

- **V1:** Single Matching Engine Node
- **Future:** Multiple Matching Engine Nodes (Cluster)

The internal design remains identical in both deployment modes.

---

# 2. Design Goals

The architecture is designed around the following goals.

- Deterministic order matching
- Price-Time Priority
- Low latency
- High throughput
- Fault isolation
- Memory-first processing
- Infrastructure independence
- Horizontal scalability
- Easy recovery
- High observability

# 4. Deployment Modes

## V1 (This Version)

```
Matching Engine Node

├── BTC Engine

├── ETH Engine

├── SOL Engine

└── DOGE Engine
```

One node owns all markets.

No distributed coordination is required.

---

## Future (Cluster)

```
Node A

BTC

ETH
```

```
Node B

SOL

DOGE
```

```
Node C

ADA

XRP
```

Markets are distributed across multiple nodes.

No changes are required to Market Engine implementation.

Only deployment changes.

# 5. Matching Engine Node

A Matching Engine Node is the deployable application.

Responsibilities

- Join Kafka Consumer Group
- Consume assigned partitions
- Create Market Engines
- Recover Market Engines
- Publish results
- Expose metrics
- Expose health endpoints

The node itself performs **no matching**.

---

# 6. Kafka Consumer

Each Matching Engine Node contains one Kafka Consumer.

Responsibilities

- Read assigned partitions
- Deserialize messages
- Validate event schema
- Forward events to the appropriate Market Engine

The consumer performs **no business logic**.

> **Client library note:** Cooperative Sticky Rebalancing (Section 14) requires a Go Kafka client that actually supports pluggable/cooperative consumer group assignors — e.g. `confluent-kafka-go` (librdkafka-based) or `sarama`. The plain `segmentio/kafka-go` consumer group implementation does not expose the same control and would not deliver the future rebalancing behavior this doc assumes. Not a blocker for V1 (single node, no rebalancing occurs), but the client library choice should be made with this requirement in mind before the cluster mode is built.

---

# 7. Market Engine Manager

The Market Engine Manager controls the lifecycle of Market Engines.

Responsibilities

- Create Market Engine
- Destroy Market Engine
- Recover Market Engine
- Track active engines
- Handle partition assignment changes (future)

The manager never performs matching.

---

# 8. Market Engine

A Market Engine is the smallest independently executable unit.

Each Market Engine owns

- One trading pair
- One Kafka partition
- One Input Queue
- One Event Loop
- One Matching Core
- One Order Book
- One Output Queue

No Market Engine shares state.

---

# 9. Internal Market Engine

```
Input Queue

↓

Event Loop

↓

Matching Core

↓

Order Book

↓

Output Queue
```

The Matching Core is completely isolated from infrastructure.

---

# 10. Event Processing

```
Kafka Consumer

↓

Input Queue

↓

Event Loop

↓

Matching Core

↓

Output Queue

↓

Publisher Layer
```

The Matching Core never communicates with Kafka directly.

---

# 11. Event Loop

Each Market Engine owns exactly one Event Loop.

```
for {

    event := <-inputQueue

    result := matchingCore.Process(event)

    outputQueue <- result

}
```

Only this Event Loop modifies the Order Book.

This guarantees

- deterministic execution
- no locks
- no race conditions

---

# 12. Matching Core

Responsibilities

- Process OrderCreated
- Process OrderCancelRequested
- Match orders
- Update Order Book
- Generate Matching Results

**`trade_id` generation:**

When a match occurs, the Matching Core generates a `trade_id` as a **UUIDv7 in application code, in memory, at match time**.

The `trade_id` is embedded in the matching result before it is placed on the Output Queue.

The Matching Engine has no database. No database round-trip occurs. This is consistent with the ID Correlation Standard — the owning service generates the ID before any persistence or publication.

The `trade_id` is the idempotency key used by Settlement Service for `SettleTrade`. Settlement Service uses it to guarantee a trade is settled exactly once even if `TradeExecuted` is redelivered.

The Matching Core does NOT

- Publish Kafka
- Update Redis
- Record Metrics
- Persist Checkpoints

---

# 13. Publisher Layer

Consumes Output Queues.

Responsibilities

Publish

- `TradeExecuted` — consumed by Settlement Service
- `OrderCancelled` — consumed by Order Service

> **Note:** There are no `OrderFilled` or `OrderPartiallyFilled` events. Fill status updates are driven by `TradeExecuted` — the Order Service updates its own order status when it observes a `TradeExecuted` event carrying its `order_id`. The ME publishes exactly two event types.

Update

- Redis — order book read replica (snapshot pushed after each match)
- Metrics
- Recovery metadata (Kafka checkpoint row)

**Checkpoint timing:**

The checkpoint row (`{topic, partition, offset}` in Postgres) is updated **after** the Kafka publish is acknowledged — never before.

If the checkpoint were written before Kafka confirms the publish, a crash between those two steps would advance the offset without the event having been delivered. On restart, the ME would skip replaying that match, causing Settlement Service to never receive the `TradeExecuted` event.

Checkpoints are written **per successful match**, not per event consumed. Writing on every `OrderCreated` consumed would add a Postgres write to the hot path. Writing per match is acceptable overhead and avoids the forever-growing replay problem.

The Matching Core never waits for these operations.

---

# 14. Kafka Design Requirements

TradeDrift relies on Kafka for deterministic event ordering.

## Event Key

Every event must use

```
key = market_id
```

This guarantees all events for a market are written to the same partition.

---

## Partition Invariant

The following topics MUST

- use identical partition counts
- use identical partitioning strategy
- be consumed by the same consumer group

Topics

- OrderCreated
- OrderCancelRequested

This guarantees every Market Engine receives all events for its market in the correct order.

---

## Consumer Group

Every Matching Engine Node joins the same Kafka Consumer Group.

Kafka assigns partitions automatically.

TradeDrift does not implement a custom routing layer.

---

## Rebalancing

### V1

Only one Matching Engine Node exists.

No rebalance occurs.

---

### Future

TradeDrift will use **Cooperative Sticky Rebalancing**.

This ensures only the partitions being reassigned are paused.

Markets that remain on the same node continue matching without interruption.

See Section 6 for the client library requirement this depends on.
